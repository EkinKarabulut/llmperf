# LLMPerf - Language Model Performance Measurement

## Introduction

LLMPerf is a tool for measuring the performance of large language models (LLMs) such as Llama 2, GPT-3, or similar models. Language models have become increasingly important in various natural language processing tasks, and it's essential to evaluate their performance accurately. LLMPerf provides a framework for conducting performance measurements and benchmarking on these models.

## Features

- **Scalable Testing**: LLMPerf can be used to evaluate language models across various scales and configurations, allowing for comprehensive performance assessments.

- **Performance Metrics**: It provides a range of performance metrics, including response time, throughput, and quality, to help you gain insights into how well your LLM performs under different conditions.

- **Custom Test Scenarios**: LLMPerf allows you to create custom test scenarios that simulate real-world usage, helping you assess model behavior in specific contexts.

- **Extensibility**: You can easily extend LLMPerf to add custom performance metrics or integrate it with your existing infrastructure for automated testing.

- **Results Visualization**: LLMPerf provides tools for visualizing and analyzing performance results, making it easier to interpret the data and identify areas for improvement.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Pip (Python package manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the LLMPerf repository:

```git clone https://github.com/your-username/llmperf.git```

2. Navigate to the LLMPerf directory:

```cd llmperf```

3. Install the required Python packages:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

### Usage

1. Define your test scenarios: Create custom test scenarios in the `scenarios/` directory. You can specify the input prompts, model configurations, and other relevant parameters.

2. Run performance tests: Execute performance tests by running LLMPerf with the desired configuration file.

```python llmperf.py --config config.yml```

3. View and analyze results: After tests are complete, you can find performance results in the `results/` directory. Use the provided tools to visualize and analyze the data.

4. Customize and extend: You can customize LLMPerf by adding your own metrics or modifying the code to fit your specific use case.

## Configuration

LLMPerf is highly configurable. You can define various parameters in the configuration file (`config.yml`) to suit your specific testing needs. The configuration file allows you to set the number of iterations, model selection, and other test-related settings.
